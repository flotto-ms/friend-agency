      <p className="text-lg mb-6">
        The Friend Quest Agency by Flotto is a community-driven service designed
        to enhance the experience of Minesweeper.online's Friendship Event held
        three times a year—during February, June, and October. The event allows
        players to engage in a fun and rewarding quest exchange, where they can
        trade quests in the game.
      </p>
      <p className="text-lg mb-6">
        While players can already trade their quests through the in-game chat,
        the Friend Quest Agency streamlines this process by providing an
        easy-to-use matchmaking system. It connects quest buyers (players
        looking to receive quests) with quest sellers (players ready to give
        quests). The agency automatically matches these buyers and sellers based
        on availability and notifies sellers when buyers are ready to receive
        quests.
      </p>
      <p className="text-lg mb-6">
        In addition to simplifying the matching process, the Friend Quest Agency
        also tracks which quests have been sent to whom and when buyers have
        available quest slots. This ensures a smoother, more organized trading
        experience and prevents any confusion over who has received which
        quests. By reducing the manual effort of tracking quests and
        availability, the agency helps players focus more on enjoying the
        Friendship Event itself, rather than dealing with logistics.
      </p>
      <p className="text-lg mb-6">
        Overall, the service is designed to optimize the quest trading process,
        making it easier and more efficient for all participants, while
        enhancing the sense of community within Minesweeper.online during the
        Friendship Event.
